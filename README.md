# Pygame.PECO
It's a RPG game based on pygame.
It is inspiread by the youtuber kids-can-code. Really appricate him, and this eidition just include Player and NPC,
but NPC doesn't have collide detection.

BTW, this is my first time of using github, I'm really not good at it, I will practice my skill latter.
